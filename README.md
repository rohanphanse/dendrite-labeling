# Dentrite Labeling

Goal: Count the number of dendrites (bushy nerve endings) with LabelBox, an AI labeling software, and analyze their properties (such as length).

Results:
```
Dendrite Data Overview:
Total # of Images: 39
Total # of Labels: 640
Total # of Neuron Labels: 321
Total # of Dendrite Labels: 319
Average # of Neuron Labels Per Image: 8.231
Average # of Dendrite Labels Per Image: 8.179
Overall Average Dendrite Length (in pixels) 142.063
